# python-plugins
some very useful python plugins ( works in VSC) and the way to use this is:
 Go and download the idlecolors file. Then create a new folder somewhere on your computer (i.e your desktop). Then move the idlecolors file to that folder. Now open python IDLE and create a new file. Save it to the same folder in which you put the idlecolors file.
 Now run the following code:
 
 from idlecolors import*
printc([color]("Hello World"))
